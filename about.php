        <h1>About Sbargle's</h1>
        <p>In the year 1999, Sbargle was on a normal journey from his home planet Garonzia when his spacecraft failed. Sbargle crash landed on the planet Earth in a country called the United States, in the state of New York. Sbargle's spacecraft was irreparably damaged in the crash and seeing as human technology is not as advanced as the technology of the Garonzians, Sbargle had no choice but to get familiar with his new surroundings and make the most of it. He took a great liking to human kind, fascinated with the activities that they choose to participate in daily. Sbargle began to study his human companions, taking note of all of their likes and dislike, analyzing what humans enjoy the most of all. In all of his studies Sbargle found that, overwhelmingly, all people like to escape their daily lives for an unforgettable getaway at some far away location from their home base. Determined to build the best getaway possible to satisfy human kind, Sbargle's Luxury Building was born! For years Sbargle saved up human currency and now has spared no expense in creating a luxury building and resort so incredible, it is sure to exceed any human's expectations. Sbargle would love it if you came to visit and cherished in his life's greatest work!</p>
